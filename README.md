## aMAP
assembly-based Metagenomics General Analysis Pipeline

Assembly-based Metagenomics General Analysis Pipeline (aMAP) is a read level generic analysis pipeline developed by the Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology (EMB) Lab at Westlake University. It is suitable for the shotgun metagenomic data derived from paired-end sequencing.

This script integrates several professional and commonly used open-source metagenomic analysis software, and it has implemented the default recommended parameters for easy and fast analysis of high-throughput DNA sequence data.
